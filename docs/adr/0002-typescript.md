# Typescript

## Status

Proposed

## Context

JavaScript is a weakly typed language, which can lead to type errors. We want to prevent this.
Typescript is the most popular and robust solution to this problem.

## Decision

Use Typescript for this project.

## Consequences

### Pros

- Typescript reduces the need for defensive programming.
- Typescript can help with defining interfaces for code that is shared between components, making the code more robust.
- Typescript prevents type errors on compile time.

### Cons

- Raises the entry barrier for newcomers to Typescript.
